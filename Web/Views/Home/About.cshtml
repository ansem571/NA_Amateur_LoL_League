<p style="text-align: left; width: 50%">
    We want to create a casual amateur LCS styled tournament built by the community, for the community.
    Our primary goal is to create a friendly community atmosphere which provides players with a medium that mimics the LCS format, 
    including weekly games, streamed and shout cast matches, and a playoff series.
